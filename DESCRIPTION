Description: 
    Performs elementary probability calculations on finite sample spaces, which may be represented by data frames  or lists.
    This package is meant to rescue some widely used functions from the archived 'prob' package (see <https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/prob/>).
    Functionality includes setting up sample spaces, counting tools, defining probability spaces, performing set algebra, calculating probability and conditional probability, tools for simulation and checking the law of  large numbers, adding random variables, and finding marginal distributions.  Characteristic functions for all base R distributions are included.
